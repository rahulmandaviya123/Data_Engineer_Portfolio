# ðŸ“– Project Documentation: Databricks & Azure Data Engineering

## 1. Introduction
This project implements a **data lakehouse pipeline** using **Databricks** and **Azure Data Lake** with a layered approach (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold).  
It is designed for real-world use cases like **e-commerce analytics**.

---

## 2. Pipeline Flow
1. **Bronze Layer**
   - Ingests raw data (orders, customers, products, regions).  
   - Stores it in Delta format.  

2. **Silver Layer**
   - Cleanses and validates data.  
   - Removes duplicates, applies schema enforcement.  
   - Joins datasets where needed.  

3. **Gold Layer**
   - Produces curated, business-ready datasets.  
   - Implements SCD Type-1 & Type-2 for dimensions.  
   - Supports incremental loads.  
   - Used for BI dashboards and analytics.  

---

## 3. Real-World Example
For an **e-commerce company**:  
- **Bronze**: Raw order logs from POS/website.  
- **Silver**: Orders validated against product catalog & customer registry.  
- **Gold**: Curated sales fact table + customer/product dimensions for BI dashboards.  

---

## 4. Data Processing Techniques
- **Batch & Streaming** ingestion.  
- **Delta Lake** for ACID compliance.  
- **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**
  - Type 1 â†’ Overwrites old data.  
  - Type 2 â†’ Keeps history with effective dates.  

---

## 5. Tech Stack
- **Azure Databricks** â€“ Processing engine.  
- **Delta Lake** â€“ Storage & transaction management.  
- **ADLS Gen2** â€“ Raw & curated data storage.  
- **PySpark** â€“ Data transformations.  
- **Power BI / Tableau** â€“ For analytics on gold layer.  

---

## 6. Deployment Steps
1. Create **Azure Data Lake** storage containers.  
2. Connect Databricks to ADLS.  
3. Configure paths in `parameters.py`.  
4. Run ingestion scripts (bronze â†’ silver â†’ gold).  
5. Validate curated data with BI tools.

## 7. Data Lineage
ðŸ“Œ Add the lineage diagram here â†’ `docs/lineage.png`.  

---

## 8. Future Improvements
- Implement CI/CD for Databricks jobs.  
- Add monitoring & alerting.  
- Extend to multi-cloud architecture.
